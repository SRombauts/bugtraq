Git Bugtraq Configuration specification
=======================================
Version 0.1, 2013-09-30


1. Introduction
---------------

Git commits are often related to specific issues (or bugs). The Git
Bugtraq Configuration allows to associate a Git commit with a
corresponding issue ID. Git clients may use this association to provide
additional functionality, like displaying a hyperlink for issue IDs
within a commit message which links to the appropriate issue tracker
web page.

The Git Bugtraq Configuration is similar to Subversion bugtraq
properties[1].


2. Configuration options
------------------------

* bugtraq.url (mandatory)

specifies the URL of the bug tracking system. It must be properly URI
encoded and it has to contain %BUGID%. %BUGID% will be replaced by the
Git client with a concrete issue number.


* bugtraq.logIdRegex (mandatory) and
  bugtraq.logPrefilterRegex (optional)

specify POSIX Extended Regular Expressions[2] which will be used to
extract the issue	ID from a commit message.

logPrefilterRegex is optional and will be used as a pre-filter to
find expressions which contain bug IDs.

logIdRegex will be used to extract the bare bug IDs from the commit
message or from the result of logPrefilterRegex, if specified.

Example: with logPrefilterRegex set to

  [Ii]ssues?:?(\s*(,|and)?\s*#\d+)+

and logIdRegex set to

  (\d+)

and having a commit message like

  Issues #3, #4 and #5: Git Bugtraq Configuration options (see #12)

logPrefilterRegex will pick "Issues #3, #4 and #5" and logIdRegex will
pick "3", "4" and "5". If logPrefilterRegex would not be set,
logIdRegex would pick "12" as well.


3. Configuration files
----------------------

There are two places where the configuration options can be specified:

* in the .gitbugtraq file in the repository root. This file is using
  the default Git config file layout.

* in $GIT_DIR/config

Options specified in $GIT_DIR/config will override options from
.gitbugtraq.

An example content of .gitbugtraq (note, that '\' need to be escaped):

  [bugtraq]
    url = https://host/browse/SG-%BUGID%
    logIdRegex = \\d+
    logPrefilterRegex = SG-(\\d+)
    
Exactly the same lines could be added as an additional section to
$GIT_DIR/config as well.
